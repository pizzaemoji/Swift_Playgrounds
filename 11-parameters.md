Chapter 11 â€” Parameters

//I'm not sure why it took me to the end of this chapter to stop writing "character" and "expert" over and over; "blue" and "red" is so much simpler!

//Twin Peaks
//I know this solution isn't perfect, but I like it. I didn't know I could put an if statment inside a for loop (like in the jumpX function). I was having problems figuring out how to get "Blue" to actually collect the gems. Originally the entire "if blue.isOnGem" statment was in the while loop above nav(), but this was causing Blue to plow right past the gems (unless it happened to stop on a corner with a gem). But because Playgrounds gives me immediate visual feedback (like writing HTML and refreshing the browser) I was able to quickly copy and paste the code into the for loop and see that, not only did it _not_ give me a red dot (indicating an error) but I was able to run the code and see Blue stop to collect each gem. I think, as a visual learner, this really helps me understand not just what the code is doing each step of the way, but how I can modify it to make it work better.
